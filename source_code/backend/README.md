## Considerations

- [Use Cloudinary as frontend node package?](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/client_side_uploading)
- Security packages such as [CORS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cors), [XSS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/xss), [Helmet](https://www.npmjs.com/package/helmet), [express-rate-limit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-rate-limit), [bcryptjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcryptjs)
